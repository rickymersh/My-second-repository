> "I grew up in Columbus, OH and moved to South Florida in 2015 where I majored in Economics and minored in Art and Music business at UM."
I am stock trader, I love music, I have worked with animals and I have my realestate license.
I am interested in being a quantitative trader, writing smart contracts for crypto projects and being a financial analyst.
I chose fintech because I'm a tech finatic and have a passion for finance and economics.
